# Language Game
This game tries to be a clone of the typical language learning programs such as Duolingo or Babel where the game will show a word in Spanish and the user will have to choose one of the 4 options in English.
Once the option is selected, the program will tell the user if he was right or wrong and will update the score.
The game has 20 questions after which the score is reset and the game starts again.
